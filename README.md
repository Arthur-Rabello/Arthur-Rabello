# üëã Hello World, I'm Arthur! üåç

I am an IT student majoring in Information and Communication Technologies, currently developing my skills through academic and personal projects. Although I don't have professional work experience yet. 

I have gained hands-on experience with Ruby on Rails, Docker, and related technologies. I am passionate about learning and continuously looking for new challenges to enhance my knowledge and skills.
